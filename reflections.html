								<h3>R1: My first few weeks at USERDES Class</h3>
								<p>These past few weeks had been hectic. All the subjects were raining of schoolwork,
									advance readings, videos to watch, activities to do beforehand and it was really overwhelming. I
									might have passed some of my assignments later than the assigned deadline, and I am just
									always asleep during online classes because I can only work at night at my home because at the
									day I have a lot of chores to do and the house is too loud to even focus. At this moment, I might
									not even be done to the “Done” activities in my trello account. I am still adjusting to this new
									change.</p>
								<p>In just a matter of weeks, this may sound dramatic but something in me changed. I have
									realized that if I do not put in more effort I would totally fail. Thinking endlessly about my
									problems will not solve it. I have learned that despite the hardships, I know at the end this will all
									benefit me. To be honest, USERDES class is really a fun and interesting class which is great
									because it is very interactive, and the activities is fun and interesting. It is unlike the other classes where it is hard to catch up. Although my problem sometimes is that I can never understand what
									the real goal is. For example, we have an activity about personas and prototype, but until now I
									can never understand what it is for. I just know what to do with it, how to do it, and what its use
									is. Moreover, there were a lot of misconceptions about this subject that were enlightened. For
									example, I though that this subject would contain heavy coding activities, but I realized that it
									wasn’t and I was so happy because this subject focuses more on design which I love because my
									coding skills are low. Another thing is that design is not only for aesthetic purposes, but it is the
									decision making or the process of creation. This subject is also not about designing projects for
									work, but it is for the people who is going to use it. The importance of understanding your users
									and needs and finding out creative ways to solve their problems. I like this subject a lot because I
									have always loved understanding and helping other people because me, myself had been helped
									by others as well.</p>
								<p>As far as I am concerned, this are challenging times. It is hard to learn with all the things
									that is happening around us. You can never truly appreciate one thing without looking at it with a
									different light. I am just trying to look at my situation in a more positive manner and it has
									helped me more to strive harder. USERDES and all of my other subjects taught me a very
									valuable lesson, that at times like this, technology will truly make us one, and what we are
									studying and learning for is what helps people go through their day-to-day lives in a crisis like
									this. I just appreciate the things that I am putting my time and effort into for now and I hope one
									day I can also be able to help others as well. </p>

								<h3>R2: Introduction to Design Thinking Process</h3>
								<p>When it comes to the design thinking process, well, like any other process, we think that
										it would contain logical steps until the end. It is just with this one, it is kind of spontaneous
										because you would be jumping from different steps from time to time. You could either go back
										from the first one or retrace steps to further enhance the entirety of the project. Moreover, every
										step is a building block for the other. I also appreciate the Design thinking mindsets that one must
										contain and encourage, because it would be an overwhelming process to be able to finish.</p>

								<p>The first thing that comes to my mind and it is also the most important step for me, is the
										part where we understand our user. The project is for them and to be able to address their
										problems and pose solutions, I think is the most important thing that we need to understand
										while we decide what and how to design. Therefore, empathy is a such a strong feat because it
										helps us jump into the lives of the people we are trying to help. I may not do much and my skills
										would might be low for now, but my eagerness I mean our eagerness I feel, is the greatest push
										we could ever have to be able to accomplish the project. Another important thing is for us to
										muster up optimism, embrace ambiguity and just make it. For me, like I have said, I am not the
										best with my technical skills, but that should not limit on what I must accomplish. I need to just
										say yes to possibilities and what I can do and what I can contribute and what I feel would help
										my users. It is kind of like, the intentions should be there and then the skills come after. Your
										ideas are what will inspire for you to move out of the line. Just do it and when in doubt, it is
										alright to have mistakes. Learn from failure because this is where we grow. An example I have
										experience with this is when me and my team mates where throwing off ideas everywhere and
										while it is good, we were raising a lot of problems that we forget where to focus on and what to
										actually cater that is why our project proposal were a bit confusing. Then we learn from all the
										criticisms we got from our classmates and teachers. Now we have a clearer goal of everything
										and started to have direction. And although it is still not the best we could come up with, it only
										means that there would always be room for changes and polishing. That is why we must iterate
										our work as much as we can until we can come to a stage where we will be confident at achieving
										the standards that stemmed from our ideas. </p>
								<p>To conclude, design thinking process, cannot be done by just yourself and in one sitting.
										One must go through a series of process, which sometimes might even be complicated at times,
										but we should trust the process and offer the best that we can. It is a process where we
										understand users, brainstorm ideas, creation of the idea, designing prototypes and doing the
										actual thing. And along the lines, we might even create even more processes beneath it,
										whatever works for the team. Afterall, design process matters on how it is being handled and not
										because it was served through a manual.</p>

									<h3>R3: Need Finding (Design Problem)</h3>
								<p><b>Week 1:</b><br />
									For brainstorming, our group decided to be able to come up with something that addresses
									reoccurring problems most especially to us students or learners, more importantly during time of
									pandemic; and that is the in dire need of quality resources for our learning. That is how we come up
									with a project idea like Module-hub. It is also a problem that we are aware of and involved in that is why we feel that it is something that we can definitely work on fully knowing what we can do and come up
									with a solution. My groupmates were cool, and we do tasks smoothly, the leader would assign, and we
									would have our respective jobs to fill in. When it was time for presentation, my alarm did not woke me up and I just woke up to a call from our leader, and he was asking where am I and that we were about to
									present, so I got really anxious and I panicked, and that is why while I was presenting, I was still
									contemplating my thoughts and my speech were kind of off, nonetheless, the presentation was swift
									and although there were a lot of corrections, I’m glad that it went well. We had corrections for the
									problem statement because it cannot point out to what we wanted to change and to what we pertain
									to, it might be because there were too many ideas that we want to put into one but I guess that is not how it works.</p>
								<p><b>Week 2:</b><br />
									This week I really enjoyed because I was able to draw for our storyboards. We also revised our
									work prior to last week’s evaluation from classmates and teacher. We added an experience map which
									was not present in the previous work, polished our problem statement, and added extra personas while
									also revising our personas. Last week’s work was not that properly arranged, and we had a lot of errors,
									but the thought was there. Then the time for class arrived, but then the teacher was not able to attend
									due to connectivity problems, nevertheless, it was fun evaluating others works, and I also review how
									they did their storyboards and it was just a fun and entertaining activity while also being able to grasp insight on what they are working on what direction their project is heading to.</p>
								<p><b>Week 3:</b><br />
									This week, I was not able to attend due to some problem I was not able to sleep because of
									something I did. This was midterms week, and everything was just raining with unfinished activities that
									I was not able to attend classes because I needed sleep badly. I was not able to participate in the
									presentation of our updated work plus the low fidelity prototype, but our leader was the one who
									created the prototype and I feel like he did a really good job and I am really grateful for him and to my other co-group member, they are both amazing. </p>

								<h3>R4: Information Architecture</h3>
								<p>This topic was helpful because we were introduced to different types of website, how they were arranged based on needs, and how information is organized. Through my experiences as a user, there were times where I will be in a website wherein it is hard to navigate through. What always happen at the end of course is I exit it. This is because I can only spare much of my time, I do not have forever, and the internet offers too much. We would not want to be stuck on a single page taking forever to figure out where the contents you are looking for is placed. </p>

								<p>Understanding Information Architecture not only helps organize data but also how it can and be presented. The time and effort you need to dedicate to perfect it is fruitful. To be able to understand such thing is also to be able to understand people. How their mind will work, how their eyes will wander, what would they be looking for, and where can they go to next, are the questions(and a whole lot more) are what we need to be pondering through a lot. And it takes a great amount of time and effort. It took hundreds of research and data gathering to be able to have websites that are functional and convenient nowadays. It has made me more appreciative of all the knowledge that has been put just so people can have an easier time. Also, with information architecture, we are organizing data therefore we are not only giving ease to the users but also to the creators. </p>

								<p>The main takeaway I got from this lesson is that information architecture is an integral aspect of designing. This is where we truly need to understand what will work best for the users. A good design can never be achieved without a good information architecture otherwise it would not make sense. The dedication of research and studying makes us ready for the planning process that is why it was a great topic to be learned.</p>

								<h3>R5: Visual Information and Design</h3>
								<p>Traversing to a deeper and more specific topics about design, we start to analyze even the smallest details and how it can affect and make the slightest (or even the biggest) of change. Most people would not even think of these things and it was interesting that we get to learn about it. I am a huge fan of designing and art and all that, that is why it was interesting, and I have truly enjoyed it. The fact that we are studying about the 'aesthetics' part of design makes me ecstatic.</p>
								<p>Moreover, visual information design makes importance of three aspects namely: typography, layout, and color. There was this video that was assigned for us to watch and it was about how a better typography can change anything. It was interesting since some events were listed most of which mistakes that occurred during awards show. And to be honest before I have watched it, I have always thought that it was the announcer's fault for saying the wrong things because how hard can it be to read something? Then I realized after watching the video that I was wrong. Bad design can make the reader feel the burden that it is their mistake and that would be all the mistake of the designer for misleading its reader. To think that a simple typographical mistake can impact hugely to people's career or even lives, say something a lot about it. </p>

								<p>Another thing is the layout. I remembered that we have an activity that plays with the layout of a website called "userinyerface" and I remembered seriously having hard time finishing it that it took me 19 minutes before I was done. It was embarrassing because when you look at others time, we would see that their time was less. My point is layout is very powerful to the point that it cannot only affect how the user can feel now, but also moments after. As a user at that time, going through the website with such ridiculous layout of course made me stress, angry and confused. Not only at that moment while I was using it, but I also felt embarrassment moments after. And that is with just the impact of the layout. Other scenarios can be for example, a user goes to this website where it displays pictures and its contents very widely on the screen. What this can do is that the user can feel insecure assuming that he/she is using a desktop computer in a public place and wants the contents to be for himself only.</p>

								<p>Last is the color. We can see colors of different designs every day from posters, videos, games, websites, clothes, cars even houses. And just because something is colorful, does not mean is pleasing in the eye. Some colors are not just meant to be together and it can affect how people can perceive the design. It is not just a matter of picking all the good colors and combining them all to look good but rather to have a good single color then find other colors that can complement that color and that is why it is important to have a good set of palette.</p>

								<h3>R6: Color Theory and Typography</h3>
								<p>Since Miss was not able to attend class that day, we were left with interesting games. I really enjoyed all of it, and not just because we were playing games but the topic itself was interesting for me. I enjoyed my time playing the games, while at the same time picking up lots of lesson. I though that because I was an editor or was interested in this kind of thing is that I will ace this, is what I thought. But I was wrong! I thought I would ace the games, but I was shock because I kept making lots of mistakes and I learned from it. What I realized is that instinct is never enough to choose the right color and font, it uses math and science combined. From its size to the psychological effect on the eyes, I thought to myself “Wow, I can never look at this aspect of design ever again.” Because I used to think that what I feel like is right, is what is right. Turns out there are a lot of things that we still need to consider. For example, the millimeter space in between letters! We played four games in total, and I was impressed by all four. However, what struck me the most was the “Better Web Type” which was Game 3. I was so shock because of how hard it was. The standard that you need to satisfy was the equilateral triangle, and to be honest I did not get that and so I had a hard time. My favorite though was the last game which was “Type War.” I enjoyed all the games, but type war was just exciting since the tension while playing it was too real. Because there was also this streak which makes it harder to be incorrect since I of course I want to keep up my winning streak for as long as I can. Anyways, my longest was 16 and I know I can do better but I got tired and gave up at the end.</p>
